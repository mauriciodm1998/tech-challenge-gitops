# FIAP - TechChallenge - Infrastructure gitops

## Description

This repository contains the terraform files of the tech challenge project, running in a AWS cloud provider.

Obs.: if would like to run the auth-service in a cluster, that's been running as a lambda, in the folder "auth-k8s" you find the k8s manifests of this project to do that.
